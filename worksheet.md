  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  code repositories
  git and github are hosting web sersvice for version control repositories.
    Which is better?
    Both GitHub and Bitbucket are great tools with unique applications. Both provide choices for private and public repositories. BitBucket is far more appropriate for projects at the business level, while GitHub is better suited for individual projects.

  Matthew Roberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
    Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
      DavePearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? 🤔 If not, what do you think happened?

  * 🤔 Which file in each project has had the most activity?

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
