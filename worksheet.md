# Task 0

Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?


  > Matthew Roberts 

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? 🤔 If not, what do you think happened
  

  > Matthew Roberts <matthew.roberts@mq.edu.au>
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?

  > Jon Mountjoy <jon@heroku.com>

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  > DavePearce <dave01001110@gmail.com>

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? 🤔 If not, what do you think happened?
  > A: most recent commit is Thu Aug 18 04:45:08 2022 +0000
  > B: most recent commit is Thu Aug 11 10:10:28 2022 +1200
  > So in the case of both projects, no, these projects are not currently active. The people writing these project have probably moved on to do something else.


# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

~~~~~
Red vs. Blue
~~~~~

# Task 3

Draw a 20 by 20 grid on a 720x720 window.  Each cell in the grid should be 35 pixels high and wide and the grid should be drawn 10 pixels off the top and left borders of the screen.  To do this, you should use the `Graphics` class from the Java libraries.  Be sure to consult the tips video for this task (it is a link in iLearn).  Without it, you will be very confused.

# Task 4

The "grid" has no identity - it is just drawn.  Later on we will need to do lots of things "with" this grid.  We will modify it and adjust it and ask it questions.  Our task here is to refactor the program to give this grid an identity.  We will create an object to represent the grid and will give that object its own `paint` method for drawing the grid.

We will also need to give an identity to each "cell" of the grid and make each cell responsible for it's own painting to the screen.

Modify the program to make these things happen.  Make a `Grid` class and a `Cell` class and organise them in a sensible way.  What fields and methods should each class have?

# Task 5

Anything that is a `JFrame` or `JPanel` can find out the position of the mouse using `getMousePosition`.  Modify your program so that mousing over a cell will "highlight" it.  Highlighted cells should be drawn in grey.  You may have to think about how you will get the mouse position from the place you can read it, to the place it is needed (the `paint` method of a `Cell` object).

# Task 6

Our `Cell` class is really a specialised rectangle and the Java API already has a `Rectangle` class.  Have `Cell` inherit from `java.awt.Rectangle` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/17/docs/api/java/awt/Rectangle.html).  It will be good to call `super` in the `Cell` constructor and to use the `contains` method that comes in `Rectangle` instead of your own.  NB:  The `contains` we wrote was graceful when given a `null` pointer for the point, the one from `Rectangle` is not, you will need to "protect" it in some way.

# Task 7

Define a `Stage` class that can contain one `Grid` object and many `Actor` objects.  There must be three separate actors, each a subclass of an `Actor` superclass and each must have its own `paint` method.  The `paint` method must take a `Graphics` parameter and draw the actor on that graphic.  Have the `paint` method specified in the `Actor` class and have each subclass define it.

Since `Actors`s are drawing themselves, they need to know where they are on the screen so each will have a `Cell` field (that is set in the constructor) indicating where on the grid they are.

Have the program start with 1 grid and 3 actors:

  * Cat (drawn blue)
  * Dog (drawn yellow)
  * Bird (drawn green)

You can place each of these three `Actor` objects in grid locations of your choosing.

# Task 8

Have a close look at your `Cat`, `Dog` and `Mouse` classes.  If they are anything like mine they are _all the same except for the colour they use_.  This repetition is "a bad thing" because if the same thing is done in three different places, we need to remember that updating one requires us to update all three.

Is there a place that you could put all the common parts?

🤔 Will this work given what you currently have?  If not, what would we need to change?

# Task 9

Draw a picture of the inheritance hierarchy you have created.  You should (loosely) use [UML notation](http://umich.edu/~eecs381/handouts/UMLNotationSummary.pdf) for your diagram.  You are using UML In this case, and all through this course, only for "a rough sketch of an idea".
